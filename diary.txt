2.11.2022
Did part 3 and 4, enhanced the sidebar and made the site responsive
added different functions for different sized screens.

3.11.2022
Added the about me page, personalized the page (changed pictures, colours etc)
Added the contact page, made it responsive. Added personal and school contacts

Overall I found the project to be a refreshing change. This was also my first touch into "proper" front-end development.
It was nice to tinker around with the different elements, add objects and make the site look more like me. 
One challenge was to find a good color combination, but I feel like I found one which suits the site well.
Another challenge was setting the pictures to be the right size, especially the portrait picture in the menu.

Some context as sass, npm and the multi-filed structure of the project was a bit confusing at first, but after using them 
I feel like I started to understand their purpose and their charasteristics.
