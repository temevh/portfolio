            <p>
                I started studying computer science at Lappeenranta Technical University in 2021. 
                Most of my time is spent around computers doing nerdy things, like programming and playing games. I have a great interest in anything and everything tech related, and lately cybersecurity has been something that I have wanted to learn.
                I also have hobbies, some of which are fairly physical. I go to the gym 3 to 4 times a week, and I practice muay-thai 2 days a week. Other hobbies include reading books and painting minifigures, like Warhammer 40k.

            <p>
                I started my own ice-cream bar when I was a bit over 10 years old. Instantly it became a hit, and got recognition, even nationwide. I got a good look into what its like to be an Entrepreneur, and learned a lot of valuable lessons first hand. 
                I stopped selling ice-cream when I deemed I was too old for it, and my little sister "inherited" the business.
